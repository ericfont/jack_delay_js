jack_delay_js is a JavaScript port of Fons Adriaensen's jack_delay from linuxaudio.org, used for testing latency via the Jack Audio Connection Kit soundserver (JACK), but once ported to javascript can be used for testing browser (or electron or nodejs) audio latency.

README from original jack_delay author Fons Adriaensen:

-------------------------------

jack_delay 0.4.2  -  25/08/2018 Maintenance release.
jack_delay 0.4.0  -  18/04/2011

Jack_delay can be used to measure the round-trip latency of a soundcard.
To do this, start the program and connect like this:

jack_delay -> playback_port -> cable from soundcard output to input -> capture port -> jack_delay

Jack_delay generates a signal consisting of 13 sine waves, measures the
phase difference between the input and output for each of these, and
computes the delay from those phase differences. The algorithm used is
one developed originally for satellite ranging -  that is measuring the
distance between a satellite and a ground station.

With a good sound card jack_delay will measure the round-trip latency
with an accuracy of around 1/1000 of a sample. The assumption is that
the delay is more or less independent of frequency. The actual value
displayed is the one for a frequency of 1/16 of the sample rate. The
phase measurement for this frequency of course only provides a result
in the range of 0..16 samples. The other frequencies are used to extend
this interval to 4096 * 16 samples, more than a second at 48 kHz.
This release should be much less sensitive to frequency-dependent delay
than the previous ones.
